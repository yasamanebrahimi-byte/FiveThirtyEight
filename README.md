# FiveThirtyEight
This project analyzes FiveThirtyEight’s 2018 primary election data to evaluate forecast accuracy and identify factors influencing candidate performance. I use EDA, hypothesis testing, and frequentist and Bayesian models to study how endorsements, demographics, and district urbanization relate to vote share and party affiliation.
